## About Me

I have been in web development professionally for a little over two years now. I specialize in building user experiences that are accessible, engaging, and aesthetically pleasing. My skills also extend into the full stack space, in particular Java, C#, and .NET applications.

When I'm away from the screen, you can usually find me enjoying the great outdoors, or playing video games with my wife, cats, and bunnies.
