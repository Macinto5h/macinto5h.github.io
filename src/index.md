## About Me

Hi, my name is Mac. I have been in software development professionally for a little over two years now. I specialize in full stack application development with Typescript, Java, and some C#. I also build websites from time to time like this one.

When I'm away from the screen, you can usually find me enjoying the great outdoors, or playing video games with my wife, cats, and bunnies.
