# About Me

Hi, my name is Macallan Camara, but you can call me Mac if you would like.

I have been a software developer for the past three years.
I specialize in full stack web application development using TypeScript, Java, and Groovy.

Sometimes I will build websites like this one in my spare time.
Other times I will work on a side project unrelated to my day to day tech stack.

When I'm away from the screen, you can usually find me doing the following:
- hanging out with my wife, cats and bunnies. 👫🐈🐈🐈🐇
- improving my chess game ♔
- strumming the ukulele ♪
- playing video games 🎮
- or enjoying the great outdoors 🏕️
