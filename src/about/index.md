# About Me

Hi, my name is Mac.

I have been a professional software developer for the past four years.
I specialize in full stack web application development particularly with the Spring and Angular frameworks.

Sometimes I will build websites like this one in my spare time.
Or I might pick up working on a project unrelated to anything I have done before.

When I'm away from the screen, you can usually find me doing the following:
- Hanging out with my wife, cats and bunny.
- Improving my chess game.
- Strumming the Kalimba.
- Playing video games.
- Or enjoying the great outdoors (especially national parks).
