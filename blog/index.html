<h2>Making Changes, Again</h2>
<p><em>2022-10-11</em></p>
<p>Since owning <code>www.mjcamara.com</code> I have changed the purpose and design of this website so many times.
The domain name is a reflection of my original intentions.
I always thought that <em>M.J. Camara</em> sounded like the name of an author, and in the beginning, I idolized the idea of me writing.
However, time has proven that there has not been much effort put into my writing at all.
Well, I'm writing a blog now, and guess what?
I changed the design of <code>www.mjcamara.com</code> yet again.</p>
<h3>1: Letting Go Of A Completely Custom Style</h3>
<p>Another dream was for me to come up with a unique and stunning style for this site, but I woke up.
Design is not my strongest passion, and I did not want to keep up with all the considerations needed to maintain it.
This website is using Bootstrap and that works great.
Bootstrap is a project that I am very familiar with and have even contributed to the code, so it felt natural to use it for my site.</p>
<h3>2: PUG</h3>
<p>One of the tools that has interested me since the beginning of my career is template rendering engines.
Out of all the ones I have been exposed to, the rendering engine that spoke out to me was PUG.
PUG defines a simple and compact syntax compared to HTML.
Although esoteric at times, the benefits of templating, mixins, and no closing tags eclipse those concerns for me.</p>
<h3>3: It Is Okay To Like Light Themes</h3>
<p>At the time of writing this, I have felt that most younger developers like myself have dark mode set for <em>everything</em> in their toolbox.
For me, both light mode and dark mode are great color schemes to use depending on context, and typically I use a mix of the two.
There is light mode to help me focus, and dark mode to prevent the eyestrain.</p>
<h3>4: Having Fun!</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, my website is my digital sandbox and I should be doing what I want with it.
We only have so much time to live on our little blue dot, and we should make the most of it.</p>
